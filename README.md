# CS---330-SNHU

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by checking the requirements and using pseudocode before beginning.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The design skills I have aquired are to create a 3D environment with various shapes, colors, pictures, and ligting.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
THe process I followed that ended up working for the project were the resources my instructor provided through git hib. THis served as guidence and gave me clarity for what I was doing during the project.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
In the future, the tactics I may use are to follow the instructions from my leadership. Weather they give me source code, or verbal guidence. These are imperitive for performence and successful programming. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by using what I have learned in previous courses. This may include but not limited to, UML diagrams, flow charts, pseudocode, or process models. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new development strategies I have used when creating the 3D scene was use to use teh requirements as a guide. The requirements were very helpful considering I have never used openGL before. I think the amount of time it would have taken to wirte the program as a whole would have been longer. Instead, the instructor was kind enough to send the class the source code for us to implement within out programs. Also, I have debugged quite a few coding errors.


How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration is very important. Without it, engineers may write a lot of lines of code. After they run the program, they may find out that what was wirtten should have been debugged as they were developing the program. So, it may not work. Iterative development serves as the means of ensuring parts of the program work before moving onto the next constructor or function. It is always good practice to write a few lines of code, then run to increase prodcutivity. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach to developing code has evolved throughout the milestones by allowing to implement what I have been learning practically through my time here at SNHU. Not only in CS-330, but also from other courses where intructors have taught us how to basically write code without actually writting it first. Such as pseudocode.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me acheive my goals by giving me the knowledge and dexterity to follow through with projects, seek help when needed, and to share ideas through discussion with other engineers. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
WHen it comes to future education. I may use this if I wanted to persue an education in computer graphics. However, I do not really see myself chasing more education within this realm. I am more accustomed to building mobile, and desktop application. Perhaps after obtaining my degree, I may learn how to build technology for air and space or medical companies. This requires wone to have knowledge to allowing code to communicate with exterior hardware. Such as software written for medical technology. There may need to be a machine of some sort to carry out the functions the code was intended to produce.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I may use this course for the purpose of implementing CPU graphics for a mobile application or website. It will feature some sort of rotating shape or figure that represents perhaps a company logo or that is in relation to what the application offers.
